# My vim config files

This is mainly on github for my benefit, so I can clone my setup / have backups etc.

If you're starting with vim, you could clone my setup you *could* ( on mac /
linux) with ...
```bash
    mkdir ~/.vim
    cd ~/.vim
    git clone --recursive https://mjeppesen@github.com/mjeppesen/.vim.git
    ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
```

... but honestly, you probably don't want to because there are lots of vim
configs on github, written by people who are much smarter than me, who know vim better, and who have put
effort into testing it on different platforms and machines.

So google "vim config" or look at:
http://vim.spf13.com/
(which is where I took a lot of the vimrc commands).
